# 🧪 Machine Learning Lab

### 🎯 What is this for?
This repository is a dedicated workspace for practicing and implementing Machine Learning algorithms. It focuses on applying theoretical concepts to code, exploring model behaviors and mastering end-to-end data pipelines without relying on pre-built abstractions.

### 🔬 Scope of Practice
I focus on four core areas of Machine Learning:

* **Supervised Learning:**
    * **Classification:** Categorizing data into distinct classes.
    * **Regression:** Predicting continuous numerical values.
* **Unsupervised Learning:**
    * **Clustering:** Grouping similar data points based on inherent patterns.
    * **Association Rules:** Discovering relationships and co-occurrences between variables.
* **Data Engineering:** Feature engineering, preprocessing, and dimensionality reduction.

### 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Language:** Python 3.x
* **Data Manipulation:** Pandas, NumPy
* **Modeling:** Scikit-Learn (sklearn)
* **Visualization:** Seaborn, Matplotlib
* **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook
